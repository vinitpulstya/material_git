Material_Git is a re-designed github page that can display information about user-- followers, no. of followings, gists
and more.
There is also functionality to see remaining requests user has for that hour, as github allows 60 requests per hour for an ip address.

With the help of fusion charts and react icons the look and functionality of app is enhanced.
4 charts have been used to calculate and display 5 most used languages by user, 5 most popular repositories, 5 most starred languages and 5 most forked repos.
